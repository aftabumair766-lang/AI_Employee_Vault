## Background & Context

### From TASK_201 Multi-Agent Assessment

TASK_201 successfully demonstrated 3 concurrent agents analyzing:
- Agent A: Architecture (Grade B+)
- Agent B: Documentation (Grade A-)
- Agent C: Execution Patterns

**Next Level Challenge**: Scale to **5+ concurrent agents** with deeper technical focus:
- Performance analysis
- Security assessment

- Code quality metrics

### Why 5+ Agents?

**Demonstrates**:
1. **Scalability**: Can coordinate more complex multi-agent workflows
2. **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific technical domain
3. **Parallel Efficiency**: 5 agents in 40-50 minutes vs 150+ minutes sequential
4. **Cross-Domain Insights**: Security + Performance + Testing intersections
5. **Enterprise Readiness**: Production-grade multi-perspective analysis

2. Create agent prompts with specific focus areas
3. Determine thoroughness levels (2 very thorough, 3 medium)
4. Plan synthesis strategy
5. Create approval request

### Phase 2: Agent Spawn & Coordination (40-50 minutes)
6. Spawn all 5 agents in single message (parallel execution)
7. Monitor agent progress
8. Collect agent outputs (200KB+ expected)
9. Log multi-agent coordination timeline

### Phase 3: Cross-Agent Synthesis (20 minutes)
10. Analyze all 5 agent reports
11. Identify cross-domain patterns

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Elements

**Risk #1**: Agent Spawn Failure (5 concurrent agents)
- **Mitigation**: Verify login status before spawning
- **Mitigation**: Spawn all 5 in single message for true parallelism
- **Fallback**: Retry failed agents individually if needed

**Risk #2**: Agent Timeout (very thorough agents may take longer)
- **Mitigation**: 2 very thorough + 3 medium to balance load
- **Mitigation**: Monitor progress, extend timeout if needed
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (can retry if timeout occurs)

**Risk #3**: Output Volume (200KB+ agent output)
- **Mitigation**: Stream outputs to files, summarize for synthesis
- **Impact**: LOW (manageable with proper file handling)

**Risk #4**: Cross-Agent Synthesis Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Structured analysis framework
- **Mitigation**: Pattern identification checklist
- **Impact**: LOW (more data = better insights)

### Approval Required

This Gold-level task requires approval due to:
- 5 concurrent agents (high computational load)
- Extended execution time (90-100 minutes)
- Very thorough analysis (2 agents)
- System-wide comprehensive assessment

**Approval Timeout**: 4 hours (Gold-level extended window)
