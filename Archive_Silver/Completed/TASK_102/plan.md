## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Analyze AI Employee Vault codebase architecture using Explore agent, then create comprehensive architecture document.

**Approach**:
1. Spawn Explore agent with "very thorough" level
2. Analyze multi-level structure (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
3. Identify core components and patterns
4. Synthesize findings into architecture document

**Silver-Level Demonstration**: Agent orchestration using Task tool with Explore subagent.

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Planning ✓
1. Create plan (this document)
2. Approve and move to Planning_Silver/Approved/

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration
3. Transition to IN_PROGRESS
4. Create Working_Silver/TASK_102/ workspace
5. **Spawn Explore agent** with prompt:
   - Analyze AI Employee Vault codebase structure
   - Focus on Bronze, Silver, Gold levels
   - Identify core governance documents
   - Document workflow patterns
   - Calculate metrics (files, tasks, etc.)
6. Capture agent findings

### Phase 3: Document Creation
7. Synthesize agent findings
8. Create architecture_analysis.md with:
   - Executive summary
   - Multi-level structure analysis
   - Core components
   - Workflow patterns
   - Design patterns
   - Metrics
   - ASCII architecture diagram
   - Recommendations

### Phase 4: Completion
9. Save document to Outputs_Silver/
10. Create completion report
11. Archive to Archive_Silver/Completed/TASK_102/
12. Return to IDLE
