## 🎯 Silver Level Objectives

Silver-level tasks should demonstrate:

### Enhanced Complexity
- Multi-step workflows beyond basic demonstrations
- Integration with external systems or APIs
- Data transformation and processing
- Feature implementations with user-facing impact

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Web Research**: Using WebFetch and WebSearch for information gathering
- **Agent Orchestration**: Spawning multiple agents for complex tasks
- **Notebook Support**: Jupyter notebook editing for data science workflows
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More sophisticated recovery mechanisms

### Workflow Features
- More complex planning requirements
- Conditional approvals based on risk assessment
- Moderate performance requirements
- Integration testing
