## 🎯 Gold Level Objectives

Gold-level tasks should demonstrate production-grade capabilities:

### Advanced Complexity
- Full lifecycle workflows from planning to deployment
- Multi-task dependencies and orchestration
- Complex integrations with external systems
- Production-grade implementations with monitoring
- Performance optimization and KPI tracking

### Elite Capabilities
- **Agent Orchestration**: Up to 10 concurrent agents for complex coordination
- **Planning Mode**: EnterPlanMode for architectural design
- **Background Processes**: Long-running operations with monitoring
- **Performance KPIs**: Track and optimize execution metrics
- **Advanced Recovery**: Multi-level rollback and recovery protocols
- **Production Deployment**: Real-world deployment scenarios

### Enterprise Features
- Extended approval workflows with escalation
- Multi-level risk assessment
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, performance)
- Complete documentation and runbooks
- Disaster recovery planning
- SLA compliance monitoring
